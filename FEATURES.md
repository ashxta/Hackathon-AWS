  - Monthly savings projections

### 3. Resource Analyzer ✅
- **Resource Inventory** (`/resources`)
  - Comprehensive table of all AWS resources
  - Real-time search functionality

  - Filter by state (running, idle, stopped, active)

- **Resource Details**
  - Resource name and ID
  - Type with visual icons
  - Current state with color-coded badges
  - Region information
  - CPU utilization monitoring
  - Monthly cost per resource
  - Last accessed timestamp

- **Smart Detection**
  - Idle resource identification (<5% CPU)
  - Cost anomaly highlighting
  - Underutilized resource warnings

### 4. Action Execution Interface ✅
- **Actions Management** (`/actions`)
  - Safe Mode toggle (recommend-only vs. auto-execute)
  - Action statistics dashboard
  - Recommendation workflow management

- **Action Categories**
  - Stop idle EC2 instances

- **Visual Feedback**
  - Toast notifications for actions
  - Loading states
  - Success/error indicators
  - Animated transitions

## Demo Data
All features use realistic simulated AWS data including:
- 8 sample resources across EC2, RDS, S3, and EBS
- 5 AI-generated recommendations
- 37 days of cost trend data
- Calculated metrics and projections

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication
- Context-based state management
- LocalStorage for session persistence
- Protected route wrapper component
- Automatic redirects

### Data Management
- Mock data generators in `src/lib/awsData.ts`
- Realistic AWS service simulations
- Dynamic metric calculations
- Memo-ized data for performance

### UI Components
- Shadcn/UI component library
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Future Enhancements
- AWS Cognito integration for real authentication
- AWS Cost Explorer API integration
- CloudWatch metrics integration
- Amazon Bedrock LLM reasoning
- Lambda function execution
- S3 report storage
- API Gateway endpoints
- Multi-cloud support (Azure, GCP)
- Team notifications (Slack/Teams)
- Natural language querying with Amazon Q

## Getting Started

1. **Visit the landing page** at `/`
2. **Sign up** for an account at `/signup`
3. **Log in** at `/login`
4. **View your dashboard** at `/dashboard`
5. **Analyze resources** at `/resources`
6. **Execute actions** at `/actions`

## Demo Credentials
For testing, any valid email and password (6+ characters) will work with the simulated authentication system.
