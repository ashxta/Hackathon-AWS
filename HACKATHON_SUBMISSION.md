## üé¨ Demo Video Script (3 minutes)

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is AutoInfra - an autonomous AI agent that uses Amazon Bedrock to optimize AWS costs.

Cloud costs often spiral out of control due to idle resources and over-provisioning. AutoInfra continuously monitors your infrastructure using Cost Explorer and CloudWatch, then uses Claude 3 reasoning to recommend and execute cost-saving actions."

### Architecture Overview (45 seconds)
"AutoInfra is built entirely on AWS services. At its core is a Bedrock AgentCore runtime that hosts a Claude 3 Haiku model for cost-effective reasoning.

The agent connects to Cost Explorer for billing data, CloudWatch for resource metrics, and Lambda functions for action execution. All analysis results are stored in S3 for audit trails.

What makes this unique is the LLM reasoning - the agent doesn't just flag idle resources, it explains WHY each action should be taken, assesses the risk, and prioritizes high-impact optimizations."

### Live Demo (1 minute 30 seconds)

**Dashboard View**:
"Let me show you the dashboard. Here we see $1,507 in monthly costs, with $994 in potential savings identified by the AI agent. The optimization score is currently 38%.

The agent has analyzed 30 days of cost trends and is forecasting a 7-day outlook. Below, we see 5 AI-generated recommendations, each with an impact level and expected savings."

**Resource Analysis**:
"In the Resources page, we can view all AWS infrastructure - 8 resources total, with 5 currently idle. The agent uses CloudWatch metrics to detect that these EC2 instances have less than 5% CPU utilization. We can filter by type and search by name or ID."

**Action Execution**:
"Now the powerful part - the Actions interface. Safe Mode is currently ON, which means the agent will recommend but not execute. Let's look at this recommendation: 'Stop idle EC2 instance i-abc123'. The agent explains its reasoning - the instance has 2% CPU usage and costs $156/month.

Notice the confidence score of 95% and risk level of 'low'. The agent has reasoned through the potential impact. If I toggle off Safe Mode, the agent can autonomously execute these actions via Lambda functions."

### Results & Conclusion (15 seconds)
"With just these 5 recommendations, we can save $994 per month - improving our optimization score to 92%. The agent continuously monitors and adapts, providing a self-healing infrastructure that reduces costs while maintaining reliability.

AutoInfra demonstrates the future of autonomous cloud management using AWS Bedrock AgentCore. Thank you!"

## üìù Submission Description (for form)

**Project Name**: AutoInfra

**Tagline**: Autonomous AWS cost optimization agent powered by Bedrock AgentCore

**Description** (500 words):

AutoInfra is an autonomous AI agent that continuously monitors AWS infrastructure and uses LLM reasoning to identify and execute cost-saving actions. Built for the AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon, it demonstrates the power of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for creating truly autonomous systems.

**The Problem**: Cloud costs spiral out of control because resources are left idle or over-provisioned. While AWS provides reporting tools, analyzing and acting on them still requires significant time and expertise. Teams often lack the bandwidth to continuously optimize their infrastructure.

**The Solution**: AutoInfra is a fully autonomous agent that:
1. Monitors billing data via AWS Cost Explorer
2. Analyzes resource utilization through CloudWatch metrics
3. Uses Claude 3 Haiku LLM for reasoning about inefficiencies
4. Recommends or autonomously executes cost-saving actions
5. Stores all analysis in S3 for audit and compliance

**Technical Architecture**: The system uses Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime as its execution environment, hosting a Claude 3 Haiku model for cost-effective LLM reasoning. The agent integrates with multiple AWS services - Cost Explorer for billing data, CloudWatch for resource metrics, Lambda for action execution, and S3 for report storage.

What sets AutoInfra apart is its reasoning capability. Rather than simple rule-based alerts, the agent uses structured LLM prompts to understand context, assess risk, calculate savings, and explain its recommendations in natural language. Each action includes a confidence score (0-100), risk level (low/medium/high), and detailed reasoning.

**Autonomous Capabilities**: AutoInfra operates in two modes:
- Safe Mode (default): Analyzes and recommends, requiring human approval
- Auto-Execute Mode: Fully autonomous with configurable risk thresholds

The agent can stop idle EC2 instances, resize over-provisioned RDS databases, archive cold S3 data to Glacier, and delete unused EBS volumes - all via Lambda functions with proper IAM controls.

**Hackathon Compliance**: AutoInfra fully meets all requirements:
- Uses Claude 3 Haiku LLM hosted on AWS Bedrock
- Implements Bedrock AgentCore Runtime primitive
- Demonstrates reasoning through structured prompts
- Shows autonomous capabilities with human oversight options
- Integrates multiple AWS APIs and external tools

**Impact**: In testing, AutoInfra identified $994/month in potential savings across a sample infrastructure, improving the optimization score from 38% to 92%. The continuous monitoring capability means it adapts to changing patterns and catches new inefficiencies as they arise.

**Future Vision**: AutoInfra represents a step toward self-healing cloud infrastructure - systems that not only monitor themselves but actively optimize for cost, performance, and reliability without human intervention.
